My name is Shawn Urban. I am a Game Design & Development <br>student at Quinnipiac University. <br><br>
I have been playing video games since I was a kid, and not <br> 
once did I find myself thinking about pursuing a different <br>
career path. Once I got to college, I hit the ground <br>
running. Being able to apply myself in a field that I love <br>
has been the most enjoyable and empowering part of my <br>
education.<br><br>

I have gained invaluable knowledge about the process of design, programming, <br>graphics, and critical thinking. Problem solving on my own and in teams has <br>
given me many opportunities to adapt to and experience varying work environments.<br>
Embracing and working around limitations has given me new perspectives towards<br>
design. Failures and successes in the creative process allow me to continue<br>
expanding my perspective. I've learned to jump into every opportunity and to <br>
never stop learning.
