<a href="photos/Lighting/9.JPG"><img src="photos/Lighting/re/9.PNG"></a> <br>
Cool, soothing background colors brings the viewer's eyes to the contrasting subject of the photo. The silhouette shape and colors are important to define a mood of relaxation.<br><br><br>


<a href="photos/Lighting/21.JPG"><img src="photos/Lighting/re/21.PNG"></a> <br>
Yellow light from the setting sun emphasizes the warm colors of the graffiti.  The subject and his mirrored shadow stand out against the bright background. <br><br>
<br>
<a href="photos/Lighting/5.JPG"><img src="photos/Lighting/re/5.PNG"></a> <br>
The symmetry of the physical environment instills stability in the viewer, while the slashing, sharp angle of light brings the viewer's attention to the bright triangle, which points to the subject. <br> <br><br>


<a href="photos/Lighting/8.PNG"><img src="photos/Lighting/re/8.PNG"></a> <br>
In contrast to the dark environment, the circular light seems to give a sense freedom to the subject, as if they are trying to break away from the darkness.<br><br>

These images focus on the use of lighting to make an interesting scene <br><br><br>
<font size="3">
<a href="photos/Lighting/13.PNG"><img src="photos/Lighting/re/13.PNG"></a> <br>
The lights are used to create a line of action through the photo. The viewer uses their imagination to follow the lights out of the photograph.<br><br>


<a href="photos/Lighting/27.JPG"><img src="photos/Lighting/re/27.PNG"></a> <br>
 The subject is blinded by the light, but the viewer needs the light to see the subject against the darkness. The subject begins to blend into the darkness by blocking out the light. There is a contradiction between what the viewer feels and what the subject feels, purely through the use of light.<br><br><br>

<a href="photos/Lighting/20.JPG"><img src="photos/Lighting/re/20.PNG"></a> <br>
This basement room was pitch-black, where nobody could appreciate the graffiti.  Fortunately, I was able to use an external manual flash to bring the art and subjects to life, making it seem as if there is on open window outside the frame.<br><br><br>

<a href="photos/Lighting/28.JPG"><img src="photos/Lighting/re/28.PNG"></a> <br>
A hole was smashed in this wall, like somebody was trying to escape. The subject seems to contemplate whether making a voyage towards the bright, wild world of light would be better than saying safe in the lonely darkness.

<a href="photos/Lighting/15.JPG"><img src="photos/Lighting/re/15.PNG"></a> <br>
The city streets glow in the light of the neon signs, perfect for moody portraits

<br><br>
<a href="photos/Lighting/19.JPG"><img src="photos/Lighting/re/19.PNG"></a> <br>
A match can only produce a small amount of light. When the perspective changes to focus closely on the match, there is a greater impact the light can have on the objects closely surrounding it.

<a href="photos/Lighting/23.GIF"><img src="photos/Lighting/re/23.PNG"></a> <br>
Blending colored lights can create certain moods.  These portraits serve as a test to how blending light looks on faces and how different feelings can be derived from the light.


<br><br>
<a href="photos/Lighting/24.PNG"><img src="photos/Lighting/re/24.PNG"></a> <br>
Dimming light by slightly pulling in the curtains helps give a somber mood to the photo.  The subject is contoured by the limited light, making a contrast to the bright and lively world outside the window.
