This is the roof of a Mental Developmental Center. After 25 years of abandonment, it is still a popular spot for rebellious teenagers. <br> <br>

<a href="photos/Environment/2.PNG"><img src="photos/Environment/re/2.PNG"></a> <br>
Amazing graffiti spanning across the supports of a small railroad. The texture of the cement is still clearly seen through the paint, giving the art a lot of character. <br><br>

<a href="photos/Environment/3.JPG"><img src="photos/Environment/re/3.PNG"></a> <br>
From the rooftops, the city life continues to move, in contrast to the still observers. <br><br>

<a href="photos/Environment/4.JPG"><img src="photos/Environment/re/4.PNG"></a> <br>
The city breathes it's final breath on the ones who look down upon it. <br><br>

<a href="photos/Environment/5.JPG"><img src="photos/Environment/re/5.PNG"></a> <br>
New perspectives form when focusing on the intricacies of smaller, organic objects, rather than giant, man-made ones.

<a href="photos/Environment/7.PNG"><img src="photos/Environment/re/7.PNG"></a> <br>
At dusk, the town shops turn on their neon signs, creating awesome scenes and visual tones as the city-goers walk past. <br><br><br>

<a href="photos/Environment/6.JPG"><img src="photos/Environment/re/6.PNG"></a> <br>
The leading lines in this photo bring the viewer into the environment, attracting attention away from the subject. The distant lights draw the eyes down the bridge, following the subjects gaze. <br><br><br>

<a href="photos/Environment/8.JPG"><img src="photos/Environment/re/8.PNG"></a> <br>
25 years of abandonment has lead to abuse of this setting; arson fires have scorched the inside and collpased the ceiling. Plant life continues to grow after the attacks on their environment.<br><br><br>

<a href="photos/Environment/9.JPG"><img src="photos/Environment/re/9.PNG"></a> <br>
Exposure to the elements has had a massive impact on this environment.  Rain, wind, and snow continues to eat away at the barely-standing structure, as plant life takes over, forming a new habitat.
